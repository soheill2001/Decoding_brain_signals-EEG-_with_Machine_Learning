# Decoding_brain_signals-EEG-_with_Machine_Learning
In this project, we have a dataset of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals of a person while he is looking at some pictures of a piano and a human. The dataset contains 3500 seconds record of 128 electrodes.
Our approach is to find the specific moment when the person looks at a favorite picture.
